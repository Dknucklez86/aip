# WEEK 2 ASSESSMENT:

## Chosen Task:

My chosen task for the week 2 assessment is Category 3: Personal Development and Productivity

## Evidence:

I enrolled in a couple of MOOC (Online) courses and started learning the courses' materials:

[DEV280x Building Functional Prototypes using Node.js] (https://www.edx.org/course/building-functional-prototypes-using-microsoft-dev280x)

I have found this course incredibly insightful. I particularly like the fact that the learning materials cover both the basics as well as practical elements of the web back-end (server-side) architecture as well as utilisation of Node.js as the solution. It provides comprehensive step-by-step processes to deploy Node.js locally as well as on Azure.

[Git Essential Training] (https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Git-Essential-Training/100222-2.html)

Having nearly completed this course, I am starting to appreciate a distributed version control system a lot more than in the past. The course provides a great revision to the Git command lines as well as Linux/Unix command lines and also provides powerful ways of managing repository effectively and efficiently.

In week 3, having completed an initial investigation of the JavaScript full stack framework (NodeJS, ReactJS, ExpressJS, Babel). 

I started this process with an initial setup that includes utilisation of package manager to manage packages & dependencies, server file setup to access the HTTP module, request function to handle requests from client (request handler), modifying port and other elements, using CDN to incorporate  Bootstrap 4 Framework, ReactJS framework and Babel interpiler.
