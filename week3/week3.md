# Week 3

## WEEK 3 SUMMARY:

In week 3, having completed an initial investigation of the JavaScript full stack framework (NodeJS, ReactJS, ExpressJS, Babel). 

I started this process with an initial setup that includes utilisation of package manager to manage packages & dependencies, server file setup to access the HTTP module, request function to handle requests from client (request handler), modifying port and other elements, using CDN to incorporate  Bootstrap 4 Framework, ReactJS framework and Babel interpiler.  

All relevant project files can be found on:

2. I enrolled in a couple of MOOC (Online) courses in week 2 and started learning the courses' materials, in week 3 I continue the learning process and completed the practical challenges to utilise npm to manage packages and also deploy Node.js, Express, React, Babel Interpiler as well Bootstrap 4 framework locally:

##### [Building Functional Prototypes using Node.js](https://www.edx.org/course/building-functional-prototypes-using-microsoft-dev280x)

This course covers the basic very well, particularly the part whereby it comprehensively explains the rationale as well the step-by-step processes to setup the server.js file to create the HTTP module to helps the server in handling hTTP requests and responses. And to setup a simple server-side API using Express.

##### [Anatomy of an HTTP Transaction](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction/)

3. I also spent a little bit of time reading through NodeJS' documentation, in particular *the Anatomy of an HTTP Transaction* and *the Getting Started Guide* sections which provide a great in-depth explanation of the technical rationale and techniques in deploying NodJS server.
