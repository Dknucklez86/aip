# Week 2

## WEEK 2 SUMMARY:

In week 2, students completed several tasks including utilisation of a Distributed Version Control (DVC) system (i.e. GitHub), management of repository using Git Command Lines, Learning the Basics about various stacks and web technologies as well as getting started with the initial investigation of a new stack for other assessments.

### WEEK 2 ASSESSMENT:

#### Chosen Task:

My chosen task for the week 2 assessment is Category 3: Personal Development and Productivity

#### Evidence:

I enrolled in a couple of MOOC (Online) courses and started learning the courses' materials:

* ![EDX](https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/mediakit/image/thumb/edx_logo_200x200.png) 
##### [Building Functional Prototypes using Node.js](https://www.edx.org/course/building-functional-prototypes-using-microsoft-dev280x)

I have found this course incredibly insightful. I particularly like the fact that the learning materials cover both the basics as well as practical elements of the web back-end (server-side) architecture as well as utilisation of Node.js as the solution. It provides comprehensive step-by-step processes to deploy Node.js locally as well as on Azure.

##### [Git Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Git-Essential-Training/100222-2.html)

Having nearly completed this course, I am starting to appreciate a distributed version control system a lot more than in the past. The course provides a great revision to the Git command lines as well as Linux/Unix command lines and also provides powerful ways of managing repository effectively and efficiently.
